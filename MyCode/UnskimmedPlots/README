The naming scheme is:

<binning variable>_<after cut on variable x>

where diff = |MHT - MET|/MET.

The cuts are applied in the order they are listed in the analysis note:

1) The initial unskimmed plots ("nocut").

2) Trigger "cut".

3) njet > 0

4) DeltaPhiMin > 0.3

5) diff < 0.5

6) lep veto

7) mt2 cut for NJET >= 2
